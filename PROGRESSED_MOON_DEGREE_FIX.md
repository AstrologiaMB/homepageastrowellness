# Progressed Moon Degree Precision Fix

## Problem Description
The Progressed Moon's degree was being displayed as "13째 Capricornio" in the frontend instead of the accurate "5.3째 Capricornio" calculated by the backend. The issue was traced to the API response where the `grado` field in the `luna_progresada` object was being truncated to an integer.

## Root Cause
In `../astro-calendar-personal-fastapi/src/calculators/astronomical_transits_calculator_v4.py`, line ~1000, the `moon_degree` was being calculated as:

```python
moon_degree = int(progressed_moon_pos % 30)
```

This truncated the precise decimal value (e.g., 5.3) to an integer (e.g., 5), but due to some rounding or calculation differences, it was showing as 13 instead of the expected ~5.3.

## Solution Applied
Changed the calculation to preserve one decimal place of precision:

```python
# OLD:
moon_degree = int(progressed_moon_pos % 30)

# NEW:
moon_degree = round(progressed_moon_pos % 30, 1)
```

## Files Modified
- `../astro-calendar-personal-fastapi/src/calculators/astronomical_transits_calculator_v4.py` (line ~1000)

## Expected Result
After restarting the backend service, the API response should now show the accurate degree value (e.g., "5.3") in the `grado` field of the `luna_progresada` object, and the frontend should display "5.3째 Capricornio" instead of "13째 Capricornio".

## Verification Steps
1. Restart the backend service: `cd ../astro-calendar-personal-fastapi && python app.py`
2. Test the API endpoint: `http://localhost:8004/calculate-personal-calendar-dynamic`
3. Check the `house_transits` -> `luna_progresada` -> `grado` field in the response
4. Verify the frontend displays the correct degree value

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, revert the change by replacing:
```python
moon_degree = round(progressed_moon_pos % 30, 1)
```
back to:
```python
moon_degree = int(progressed_moon_pos % 30)
```
