# Progress Status

## What Works

*   **Basic Project Structure:** Next.js App Router is set up with a root layout and nested routes for Calendario and Cartas sections.
*   **Welcome View:** The homepage (`/`) correctly displays the welcome message card.
*   **Shared Layout:** The `app/layout.tsx` is in place to provide a persistent sidebar and header structure. Intermediate `layout.tsx` files ensure the main layout is applied to section routes.
*   **Sidebar Navigation:** The sidebar menu items and their URLs are updated for Calendario and Cartas sections.
*   **Dynamic Routing:** Navigating to `/calendario/general`, `/calendario/personal`, `/cartas/horaria`, `/cartas/tropica`, and `/cartas/draconica` loads the corresponding placeholder pages (or the integrated `CalendarioGeneral` component for `/calendario/general`).
*   **Dynamic Breadcrumb:** The `DynamicBreadcrumb` component is created and integrated into the header, and it should update based on the current route.
*   **"Calendario General" (Phase 1):** The basic layout, week navigation, "Back to Today", and date selection menu (with correct week numbering) are implemented and responsive. Date utility functions are available in `lib/date-utils.ts`.
*   **Collapsed Sidebar Flyout (Hover):** The `SidebarFlyout` component is implemented to provide hover-triggered flyout menus for items with sub-options when the sidebar is collapsed.
*   **Homepage Layout Behavior:** The sidebar starts expanded on the homepage, and the sidebar toggle icon and breadcrumb are hidden on the homepage.

## What's Left to Build / Refine

*   **Verify Layout and Navigation in Browser:** Confirm that the shared layout, sidebar behavior (expanded on homepage, collapsible elsewhere, hover flyouts), and dynamic breadcrumb are working correctly across all relevant routes in the browser.
*   **Implement `disableToggle` for Sidebar:** If needed, modify the `SidebarProvider` component to support disabling the toggle functionality on the homepage.
*   **"Calendario General" (Phase 2+):** Implement the event card design, CSV data reading, and rendering of astrological events within the calendar.
*   **Implement Other Section Components:** Develop the functional components for other sections (Calendario Personal, Cartas, Rectificacion Carta, Astrogematria, Horas Planetarias) and integrate them into their respective `page.tsx` files.
*   **Refine Styling and Responsiveness:** Further refine the UI and ensure full responsiveness across all components and layouts.
*   **Authentication and Data Fetching:** Implement the authentication logic and actual data fetching from CSV files or a future backend.
