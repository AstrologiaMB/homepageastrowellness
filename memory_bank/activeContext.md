**Current Work:**
Continuing to resolve the discrepancy in the Progressed Moon's degree displayed in the Astrowellness application. The backend was previously corrected for an `AttributeError` related to `immanuel` library compatibility. Unit tests confirmed the Progressed Moon calculation is accurate (~5.3° Capricorn), but the frontend still shows "13° Capricorn".

Investigation revealed that the API response from `http://localhost:8004/calculate-personal-calendar-dynamic` is sending `13` in the `grado` field of the `luna_progresada` object within the `Tránsito Casa Estado` event. This indicates the issue is in how the precise calculated value is formatted in the final API response.

**Key Technical Concepts:**
*   `immanuel` library: Python library for astrological calculations.
*   FastAPI: Python framework for the backend microservice.
*   Next.js / React: Frontend frameworks.
*   Frontend/Backend Communication: REST API consumption.
*   Progressed Moon Calculation: Specific astrological logic.
*   JSON Response Format: Data structure expected by the frontend.

**Relevant Files and Code:**
*   `natal_chart_corrected.py`: Corrected natal chart calculation logic.
*   `../astro-calendar-personal-fastapi/src/calculators/natal_chart.py`: Main backend file for natal chart.
*   `../astro-calendar-personal-fastapi/src/calculators/progressed_moon_transits.py`: Calculates progressed moon conjunctions.
*   `../astro-calendar-personal-fastapi/src/calculators/astronomical_transits_calculator_v4.py`: **Identified as the source of the issue.** This file's `calculate_house_transits_state` method is incorrectly truncating the `moon_degree` to an integer.
*   `../astro-calendar-personal-fastapi/app.py`: Main FastAPI application, orchestrates calculator calls.
*   `validate_progressed_moon.sh`: Validation script.

**Problem Solving:**
*   **Initial Problem:** `AttributeError: 'Natal' object has no attribute 'to_dict'` in backend.
*   **Solution Applied:** Reverted to backup and implemented `natal_chart_corrected.py` for `immanuel` compatibility.
*   **Current Problem State:** Progressed Moon calculation is accurate in backend (~5.3° Capricorn), but API returns `13°` in the `grado` field of the `luna_progresada` object within `house_transits` for `Tránsito Casa Estado` events. This causes incorrect display in the frontend.

**Pending Tasks and Next Steps:**
✅ **COMPLETED:** Modified `../astro-calendar-personal-fastapi/src/calculators/astronomical_transits_calculator_v4.py` to round `moon_degree` to one decimal place instead of truncating it to an integer.
    *   **Change Applied:** Changed `moon_degree = int(progressed_moon_pos % 30)` to `moon_degree = round(progressed_moon_pos % 30, 1)`.
    *   **Backend Service:** Restarted successfully.

**Current Status:**
*   **Birth Time Correction:** User provided correct birth time: 21:12 (not 12:00 as used in initial tests).
*   **Next Step:** Test API with correct birth time (21:12) to verify the Luna Progresada shows correct position (~5.3° Capricornio).
*   **Final Verification:** Confirm frontend displays the corrected degree value.
